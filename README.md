Aes0p - A game made in 72 hours for the [2014 GDSE Summer Game Jam](http://meta.gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/1637/the-2014-gdse-summer-game-jam)
=================

Aes0p is my entry to the 2014 GDSE Summer Game Jam. Aes0p took me just under 72 hours to complete and won me 5th place.

## Theme ##
From GDSE - 
  "each participant chooses a gameplay concept from an existing game, and builds a game around it, trying to give the concept a twist or make it better."
  
## Concept
For my entry, I chose to create a Frogger clone with a time-altering twist. Players who grab the hourglass powerup slow down time (in implementation it really just alters time, making some things slow down but speeding up others. There's only so much you can do in 72 hours.)
